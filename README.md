# NumberGuessingGame_Java
This is a simple number-guessing game implemented in Java. It was one of my coding projects from last semester when I was learning to code.

# Description
This program generates a random number between 1 and 10,000. The user is then prompted to guess the number. The program provides feedback to help the user narrow down their guess. The user continues guessing until they correctly identify the random number.

# Code Structure

### MainDriver.java
This is the main class that handles user input, generates a random number, and manages the game loop.

### Runner.java
This class contains the logic for evaluating the user's guess against the generated random number.

### Exercise3Test.java
This class contains JUnit tests for the Runner class to ensure that the guessing logic is functioning correctly.
